## üìã Included Files

* ‚úÖ `core-site.xml`
* ‚úÖ `hdfs-site.xml`
* ‚úÖ `yarn-site.xml`
* ‚úÖ `mapred-site.xml`
* ‚úÖ `hadoop-env.cmd`
* ‚úÖ `WordCount.java`
* ‚úÖ `MaxMin.java`

These files are tested and verified for a **smooth Hadoop setup with WebUI access** on Windows using Java 8 and winutils.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Folder Structure

Ensure you create these directories before running Hadoop:

```text
F:/hadoop/data/namenode
F:/hadoop/data/datanode
```

Provide **full read/write permissions** for all users.

## üöÄ Key Commands to Run

```bash
# Format NameNode
hdfs namenode -format

# Start HDFS
start-dfs.cmd

# Start YARN
start-yarn.cmd
```

## üìù Java Programs Included

### 1. `WordCount.java`  
This is the classic Hadoop MapReduce example for counting word occurrences in a text file.

**Key Concepts:**
- Mapper and Reducer implementation
- Jar compilation with Hadoop classpaths
- Running MapReduce jobs on local HDFS directories
- Input and Output folder setup in HDFS

**Execution Command:**
```bash
hadoop jar WordCount.jar WordCount /WordCount/Input /WordCount/Output
``` 

---

### 2. `MaxMin.java`

This program analyzes real-world weather datasets (NOAA format) to identify **Hot Days** and **Cold Days** based on temperature thresholds.

**Key Concepts:**

- Working with real NOAA datasets 
- Extracting fields using substring operations 
- Conditional filtering for min/max temperatures 
- Processing data using MapReduce logic 

**Execution Command:**

```bash
hadoop jar MaxMin.jar MaxMin /Weather/Input /Weather/Output
```
